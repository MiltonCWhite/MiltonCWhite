## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a motivated IT professional with a passion for solving problems, learning new technologies, and helping others. I recently earned my **CompTIA A+ certification** and have hands-on experience with setting up ticketing systems, managing networks, configuring Active Directory, and using tools like Wireshark and Microsoft Azure.

I'm actively building out my skills and projects to launch my career in **IT Help Desk Support**.
